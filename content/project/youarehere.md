#### INTRODUCTION

You Are Here Project is a multi-layered art project in which the
content of the *key* image reveals itself in a series of settings and
*installations*.

User friendly description to both Italian and English speaking people:
The You Are Here Project raises questions about the ethical, political
and cultural voids of contemporary society.

The Internet has given us a planet without borders. At the same time,
and in contrast, the major nation-states modify their political
strategies to create self-limiting reactionary ideologies and
lifestyles.

In the You Are Here Project, the red reference *spots* move. Thus the
reference points shift and lose their geographical coordinates and as
such are points of reference that are continually in flux.

In Venice the You Are Here Project reference point *spots* are in
visible motion on T-shirts, shopping bags, stickers and flyers. The
reference point spots exist and move in other real and “virtual”
locations.

In the Rome installation at MACRO (Museum of Contemporary Art of Rome)
the *spots* move in mirrored reflections. On the internet they are
manifest in a location-less *virtual gallery*, video installation and
still imagery.

As in You Are Here we can only assume the effect, the red final point,
while the cause may vary and therefore remains both omnipresent and
undetermined. In life there is no objective reality, there are many
different truths.
